<p><strong>IHLARA VALLEY – TREK</strong><br>Early Christians have constructed their rock houses and temples by carving the tuffs in the valley of Ihlara, through the valley runs the Melendiz River.

<p><strong>GOREME ESENTEPE (PANAROMIC VIEW)</strong><br>The magnificent landscape around Goreme has been formed from its solidified lava streams, its ash and tuff stone, all dating from the Neocene period.

<span class="accordion-icon"></span>PARAGLIDING TOUR</h2>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>Imagine yourself as a bird. You spread your wings and take flight. Feel the currents of air rushing past your face. Feel the wind in your hair. Look out to the majestic mountains on the horizon. Look down to the turquoise water and sand beaches below. This is a thrill most earthbound humans never have a chance to experience.</p>
<p>Since 1999 we have been taking people to the top of Baba Dag to experience the thrill of flight. The eight full time pilots on our staff all have 10 to 15 years of experience and are Internationally Certified Tandem Pilots qualified to fly all over the world. All our pilots speak perfect English.</p>
<p>We will pick you up at your hotel in Fethiye, Calis Beach or Ovacik and take you to the top of Baba Dag, 6,500 feet above sea level. The 40 minute drive in the comfort and safety of our new modern truck is a safari in itself.</p>

<p>Termessos (or Thermessos) was a Pisidian city built at an altitude of more than 1000 meters at the South West side of the mounatin Solymos (modern day Gulluk Dagi) in the Taurus mountain range.</p>
<p>It lies 30km to the North West of Antalya. It was founded on a natural platform on top og Gulluk Dagi soaring to a height of 1,665 meters from among the surrounding travertine mountains of Antalya which average only 200 meters above sea level. Termessoss is one of the best preserved and untouched ancient cities in Turkey.</p>
<p>Termessos constitutesan unusual synthesis of a large number of rare plants and animal species which are under protection in the Termessos National Park. Concealed by a ultitude of wild plants and bounded by dense pine forest, the site, with its peaceful and untouched appearance, has a more distinct and and impressive atmosphere than other ancient cities. Becuase of its natural and historical riches, the city has been included in a National Park bearing its name.</p>
<p>Visting Termessos we have lunch close to the Duden Waterfall.</p>
